## Executive Summary

This Pattern (v2) evolves the Grafana Cloud stack management framework defined in Pattern 005. While Pattern 005 established excellent foundational principles (Single Finastra Org, GitOps workflow, Terraform automation), its implementation of a **per-Product stack model** has led to extreme operational sprawl, unsustainable Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), and fragmented observability. 

This document outlines a strategic shift to a **Business Unit (BU) aligned stack model**, consolidating the ecosystem into core BU stacks (e.g., Lending, Payment, Universal Banking). This architecture leverages Grafana Folders, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Label-Based Access Control (LBAC) to enforce strict enterprise-grade product isolation and autonomous self-service. Crucially, it drastically reduces operational overhead while fulfilling strict organizational requirements around cost attribution, SRE multi-tenant access, and cross-tier environment visibility.

## Strategic Rationale (Motivation)

The initial implementation of Pattern 005's per-Product stacks resulted in an unmanageable proliferation of Grafana Cloud environments. This architecture debt caused:
- **Massive Operational Overhead:** Governing, upgrading, and auditing 100+ individual stateful stacks is not scalable.
- **Asset Duplication:** Common infrastructure dashboards (e.g., Kubernetes, Nodes) required deployment and synchronization across 100+ disparate instances.
- **Complex SRE Access Management:** DevOps/SRE teams supporting multiple products required disparate roles mapped across dozens of isolated physical boundaries, increasing identity sprawl.
- **Siloed Observability:** Physical stack separation inherently blocked cross-tier views (Dev/Stage/Prod) and made cross-product correlation within a BU impossible.

By consolidating physical boundaries to the Business Unit level, we mitigate the blast radius of misconfigurations while unlocking massive operational efficiency, scalability, and centralized governance.

### Goals & Requirements

Based on the architectural requirements established by the Observability Pod lead, this design strictly satisfies the following:

1. **Scalability:** Accommodate 2,500+ users and 100+ products across BUs. Grafana Cloud's active series limits per stack are accounted for by dividing load across BU-aligned stacks.
2. **Strict Product Isolation:** No product team may access telemetry or assets (dashboards/alerts) of another product, even within the same BU. Enforced structurally via Folders and LBAC/RBAC.
3. **Environment Tiering:** Dev/Stage/Prod are logically separated to prevent noise, but reside in the same BU stack to allow *opt-in cross-tier views*.
4. **Self-Service:** Teams are empowered to create/update/delete their configuration items (dashboards, alert rules, data-source wiring) without central team bottlenecks via IaC.
5. **Data Residency:** Stacks are deployed in specific Grafana Cloud regions matching data residency laws of the monitored workloads.
6. **Cross-Product SRE Access:** DevOps/SRE teams can be granted access to exactly the products they support across the BU, without receiving blanket access.
7. **Cost Attribution:** All consumption is strictly attributable to specific products via enforced label taxonomies.
8. **Automated IaC:** Zero manual click-ops. Stack creation, RBAC, and wiring are 100% automated.

### Non-Goals
- Modifying how telemetry data is generated at the application level (this relies on standard OpenTelemetry practices).
- Migrating PCI-DSS or heavily regulated environments that strictly require dedicated, physically isolated stacks (these remain explicitly defined exceptions).

### Org structure

The structure moves from per-Product to per-Business Unit:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Finastra Org] --> B[Stack: AZR-C03-LEND-0001 <br> Lending BU]
    A --> C[Stack: AZR-C03-PAYM-0001 <br> Payment BU]
    A --> D[Stack: AZR-C03-UBNK-0001 <br> Universal Banking]
    A --> E[Stack: AZR-C03-TCMG-0001 <br> TCM]
    A --> F[Stack: AZR-C03-CORN-0001 <br> Cornerstone & SES]
    
    B --> B1(📁 Product: LaserPro)
    B --> B2(📁 Product: LoanIQ)
    
    C --> C1(📁 Product: Pay2Go)
    C --> C2(📁 Product: GlobalPay)
    
    D --> D1(📁 Product: FusionBank)
    D --> D2(📁 Product: Equation)
    
    E --> E1(📁 Product: Kondor)
    E --> E2(📁 Product: Front Arena)
    
    F --> F1(📁 Product: Cornerstone)
    F --> F2(📁 Product: SES)
```

Within each BU stack, Products are segregated into **Folders**. This addresses the operational concerns of v1 while satisfying all isolation requirements:

- **Empowerment:** Product teams get Editor/Admin rights at their specific Folder level via RBAC.
- **Data Residency:** A BU can have multiple stacks in different regions (e.g., `AZR-C03-LEND-0001` for US Central, `AZR-E01-LEND-0001` for EU) to satisfy data laws.

### Naming

The naming convention is simplified to represent the BU and an Index, replacing the specific Product ID. The environment tier is removed from the stack name to allow Dev/Stage/Prod to coexist in the same stack for cross-tier visibility.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Provider<br>AZR] --> B[Region<br>C03]
    B --> C[Business Unit<br>LEND]
    C --> D[Index<br>0001]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```
Example: `AZR-C03-LEND-0001`

### Consumption & Isolation

Instead of relying on the physical stack boundary for isolation, this model relies heavily on **Standardized Labels**, **RBAC**, and **LBAC (Label-Based Access Control)**.

All ingested data MUST contain the following enforced taxonomy:
- `bu` (e.g., lending)
- `product` (e.g., laserpro)
- `env` (e.g., prod, stage, dev)
- `region`

**Fulfilling Isolation Requirements:**
- **Product Isolation:** LBAC policies generated by Terraform bind to Entra ID groups. A user in the LaserPro group gets an LBAC policy `{product="laserpro"}`. They physically cannot query data for `product="loaniq"`.
- **Environment Isolation & Cross-Tier Views:** Because Dev, Stage, and Prod data for LaserPro reside in the same stack, they are logically separated by the `env` label. Dashboards default to `env="prod"` to prevent noise, but users can opt-in to cross-tier views by changing the dashboard variable to `env=~"prod|stage"`.
- **Cross-Product SRE Access:** An SRE team supporting both LaserPro and Pay2Go is granted an LBAC policy `{product=~"laserpro|pay2go"}` and assigned RBAC to both product folders.

### Centralized Alerting & Noise Reduction (Hardened Flow)

Consolidating 100+ product stacks into a shared BU-aligned architecture centralizes the Alertmanager. Without strict controls, a poorly written `inhibit_rule` by one product team could inadvertently suppress critical alerts for another product team (cross-tenant suppression).

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Alert Rule Submitted via PR]

    subgraph Hardening[Hardened Alertmanager Flow]
        G1[Family Isolation<br/>alert_family label]
        G2[Identity Matching<br/>equal: namespace, cluster, name]
        G3[Jira vs OnCall Separation<br/>notify=jira or severity=page]
        G4[GitOps Enforcement<br/>CI rejects unlabeled rules]
    end

    Output[Tenant-Isolated Alert Delivery<br/>Cross-tenant suppression: structurally impossible]

    Input --> G1
    Input --> G2
    Input --> G3
    Input --> G4
    G1 --> Output
    G2 --> Output
    G3 --> Output
    G4 --> Output

    classDef input fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#1b5e20,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
    classDef guardrail fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
    classDef output fill:#dae8fc,stroke:#0d47a1,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;

    class Input input;
    class G1,G2,G3,G4 guardrail;
    class Output output;
```

To prevent this, the architecture implements a **Hardened Alertmanager Flow**:
- **Family Isolation (`alert_family`):** All alerts are strictly categorized (e.g., `app-availability`, `custom-resource`). A critical alert in one family cannot inhibit alerts in another.
- **Identity Matching (`equal` labels):** Inhibit rules strictly match on `namespace`, `cluster`, and `name`. This ensures Team A's critical database alert only suppresses Team A's minor database alerts, completely isolating Team B.
- **Jira vs OnCall Separation:** Alerts generating Jira tickets (`notify: jira` with `priority` labels) are logically separated from OnCall paging alerts (`severity` labels) to prevent ticket rules from muting active pages.
- **GitOps Enforcement:** The GitOps pipeline automatically rejects any alert rules that do not include the mandatory `namespace` and `alert_family` labels.

### Management

The deployment and management flow remains mechanically identical to Pattern 005, enforcing "no manual click-ops":
1. Contributor updates IaC in the `main` branch.
2. PR approved by Product CODEOWNERS.
3. Merge triggers GitHub Actions.
4. Release branch triggers Terraform Cloud.
5. Terraform updates Grafana Cloud (Stacks, Folders, Data Sources, RBAC, LBAC) and Azure Entra ID.

### Repository layout

The repository layout is adjusted to group configurations by BU and then by Product.

```bash
├── .github/
│   └── CODEOWNERS               # Permission configuration per BU and Product
├── organisations/               
│   ├── Lending/                 # BU Level

```

### User stories

#### Story 1: Cost Attribution
> **As** a Finastra VP
> **I want** to see exactly how much Grafana Cloud consumption is attributable to the LaserPro product
> **So that** I can accurately chargeback the cost to that P&L.

**Implementation:** With stacks consolidated by BU, billing at the stack level shows the entire BU's consumption. Terraform provisions cost-attribution dashboards within the stack that filter the `grafanacloud_usage` metrics by the enforced `product="laserpro"` label, providing exact active series, log volume, and trace span costs.

## Pros & Cons (v1 vs v2)

| Aspect | v1 (Per-Product Stacks) | v2 (BU-Aligned Stacks) |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Management Overhead** | High (100+ stacks to maintain) | Low (~5-6 stacks) |
| **Cross-Tier Environment Views**| Impossible | Supported natively |
| **SRE Multi-Product Access** | Complex (Requires access to many stacks) | Simple (Combined LBAC/RBAC in one stack) |
| **Data Isolation** | Physical (Stack level) | Logical (LBAC + RBAC level) |
| **Cost Attribution** | Native (Stack billing) | Label-based (Requires strict labeling) |

## Drawbacks

- **Label Discipline:** Isolation and cost attribution now entirely depend on strict enforcement of ingestion labels (`product="xyz"`). If ingestion pipelines drop these labels, data attribution fails. This must be enforced at the collector/Alloy level.

## Alternatives

- **Continue with Pattern 005 (Per-Product):** Rejected due to the unsustainable operational burden of managing hundreds of stateful environments and the inability to provide cross-tier observability.
- **Single Finastra Global Stack:** Rejected due to guaranteed scaling limit breaches (active series limits) and excessive blast radius if configuration is corrupted.

```

1. **Provision New Stacks:** Create the BU-aligned stacks via Terraform.
2. **Update Collectors:** Shift telemetry ingestion endpoints from the old per-product stacks to the new BU stacks, enforcing label injection (`product`, `env`, `bu`) at the collector level.
3. **Migrate Assets:** Use automation to copy dashboards and alerts from old stacks into their respective product folders in the new stacks.
4. **Deprecate:** Set old stacks to read-only, then delete after 60 days.

## How we teach this
- Update existing documentation to focus on Folder and LBAC concepts rather than Stack concepts.
- Document labeling taxonomies as a strict governance artefact.

## Security Implications
Relies heavily on LBAC and RBAC. A misconfigured LBAC policy in Terraform could expose Product A's data to Product B. We will implement strict PR validation to ensure LBAC policies match the `CODEOWNERS` hierarchy, ensuring zero cross-product data leakage.
